Some development notes:

- May need to add install, uninstall, and test sections to the package file
- Need a way to sandbox, for example similar to the repo_dir option from chicken 5 chicken-install
- Should first get everything working using a local unpacked copy of a package
- Then figure out how to make it work remotely. Probably will want to zip everything up.
- Big problem is how to handle external reps such as C libraries
- Dep management is hard and may require a separate index. Let's do that later as part of the distributed solution. Initially dep will just be informational.
